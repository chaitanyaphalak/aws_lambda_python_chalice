# aws_lambda_python_chalice
Used the framework https://github.com/aws/chalice to build serverless AWS lambda api. 
Chalice is a python framework, so used python to build this app. The github page for chalice has some great tutorials.
Also, documentation is available at http://chalice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
